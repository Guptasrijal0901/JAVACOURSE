Access modifiers/specifiers in Java are keywords that specify the 
accessibility or visibility of classes, 
methods, and variables within a program. 
There are four main types of access modifiers:

1. **Public**: This is the least restrictive access modifier.
Public members can be accessed from any other class, 
regardless of where it is located.

2. **Protected**: 
Protected members are accessible within the same package and subclasses 
(even if they are in different packages). 
It's a bit more restricted than public.

3. **Default (no modifier)**: If no access modifier is specified, 
it is considered to have default access. 
Default members are accessible only within the same package.

4. **Private**: This is the most restrictive access modifier.
Private members can only be accessed within the same class.

In short, access modifiers control the visibility of classes, 
methods, and variables, helping to enforce encapsulation and 
maintain the integrity of the code by restricting 
access to certain parts of the program.
