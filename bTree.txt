Binary Tree
- A hierarchical data structure where each node has at most **two child nodes**.
- These two child nodes are referred to as the **left child** and **right child**.
- It is widely used in algorithms and problems related to sorting, searching, and organizing hierarchical data.

Levels in a Tree
- Definition: The level of a node represents its distance from the root node.
- Root node is always at **level 0**.
- Child nodes of the root are at **level 1**, their children are at **level 2**, and so on.
- It helps in visualizing the structure of the tree and is often used in traversal algorithms like **level-order traversal**.

Depth of a Node
- Definition: The depth of a node is the number of edges from the root to that specific node.
- The root node has a depth of **0**, and the depth increases as you move down the tree.
- **Depth = Level, so they are often interchangeable in meaning.

Subtree
- Definition: A subtree is any smaller tree that exists within a larger tree, starting from a specific node.
- It includes the selected node and all its descendants.
- For instance, in a tree, selecting a child node and treating it as the root forms a subtree.
- Subtrees are useful in recursive algorithms and tree-related problem-solving.
