Sure, I'll explain the process of this code in a simple manner.

### Overview
This code attempts to solve the N-Queens problem using a backtracking approach. The goal of the N-Queens problem is to place `N` queens on an `N x N` chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other (i.e., no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal).

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Initialization (main method):**
    - The code initializes a `2x2` chessboard with `n = 2`.
    - Each cell of the board is initially set to `'.'` to represent an empty cell.
    - The `nQueens` function is called with the initialized board and starting row `0`.

2. **nQueens function:**
    - This function is a recursive function that attempts to place queens row by row.
    - **Base Case:** If `row == board.length`, it means all queens have been placed successfully, so the board is printed using the `printBoard` method and the function returns.
    - **Column Loop:** For each column `j` in the current row, the function attempts to place a queen:
        - A queen `'Q'` is placed at `board[row][j]`.
        - The function calls itself recursively to place queens in the next row (`row + 1`).
        - After the recursive call, the queen is removed (`board[row][j] = '.'`) to backtrack and try the next column.

3. **printBoard function:**
    - This function prints the current state of the chessboard.

### Example Run (n = 2):
1. The board is initialized as:
    ```
    . .
    . .
    ```

2. The `nQueens` function is called with `row = 0`:
    - Try placing a queen at `board[0][0]`:
        ```
        Q .
        . .
        ```
        - Call `nQueens` with `row = 1`:
            - Try placing a queen at `board[1][0]`:
                ```
                Q .
                Q .
                ```
                - Call `nQueens` with `row = 2` (base case, print the board and return):
                    ```
                    --------chess board--------
                    Q .
                    Q .
                    ```
            - Backtrack and try `board[1][1]`:
                ```
                Q .
                . Q
                ```
                - Call `nQueens` with `row = 2` (base case, print the board and return):
                    ```
                    --------chess board--------
                    Q .
                    . Q
                    ```
    - Backtrack and try `board[0][1]`:
        ```
        . Q
        . .
        ```
        - Call `nQueens` with `row = 1`:
            - Try placing a queen at `board[1][0]`:
                ```
                . Q
                Q .
                ```
                - Call `nQueens` with `row = 2` (base case, print the board and return):
                    ```
                    --------chess board--------
                    . Q
                    Q .
                    ```
            - Backtrack and try `board[1][1]`:
                ```
                . Q
                . Q
                ```
                - Call `nQueens` with `row = 2` (base case, print the board and return):
                    ```
                    --------chess board--------
                    . Q
                    . Q
                    ```

Since `n = 2` does not have a valid solution for the N-Queens problem (it's impossible to place 2 queens on a 2x2 board without them threatening each other), this algorithm will print invalid boards, demonstrating the placements attempted rather than finding a solution.

### Summary
- The code tries to place queens row by row.
- It prints the board whenever it has placed queens in all rows.
- It uses backtracking to remove a queen and try a new position if placing a queen leads to an invalid solution.
