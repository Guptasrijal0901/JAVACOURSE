//In Java, we don't write destructors (or finalizers) directly because 
//Java's automatic garbage collection system takes care of memory management for us. 

//The garbage collector automatically cleans up objects that are no longer being used, 
//reclaiming their memory. This removes the need for explicit destructors like 
//in some other programming languages. 

//This approach simplifies memory management and helps prevent issues like memory leaks 
//or dangling pointers, making Java programs more reliable and easier to maintain. 
//So, we don't write destructors in Java because 
//the language handles memory cleanup automatically.
