In Java, an `Array` and an `ArrayList` are both used to store collections of elements, but they have key differences:

### 1. **Size and Resizing**
- **Array**: Has a fixed size defined at the time of creation. Once an array is created, its size cannot be changed.
- **ArrayList**: Is a resizable array implementation provided by Java's Collections Framework. It can grow or shrink dynamically as elements are added or removed.

### 2. **Performance**
- **Array**: Provides faster access time for elements, as it stores elements in contiguous memory locations. However, it does not support methods for dynamically resizing or manipulating the collection.
- **ArrayList**: Slightly slower than arrays due to dynamic resizing and the overhead of ensuring type safety and memory management.

### 3. **Type and Storage**
- **Array**: Can store both primitive types (like `int`, `char`, etc.) and objects. The data type must be specified when the array is declared.
- **ArrayList**: Can only store objects. If you need to store primitive types, they must be wrapped in their corresponding wrapper classes (like `Integer` for `int`, `Double` for `double`, etc.).

### 4. **Usage and Methods**
- **Array**: Basic operations like access, insertion, and deletion are supported. You must use loops to iterate through elements.
- **ArrayList**: Provides various utility methods (like `add`, `remove`, `contains`, etc.) and supports dynamic resizing. It also implements the `List` interface, which means it can be easily used with other collection types and interfaces.

### 5. **Initialization and Syntax**
- **Array**: 
  ```java
  int[] numbers = new int[5]; // Array of integers with fixed size 5
  String[] names = {"Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"}; // Array with initialization
  ```
- **ArrayList**:
  ```java
  ArrayList<Integer> numbers = new ArrayList<>(); // ArrayList of Integer objects
  numbers.add(1); // Adding elements
  numbers.add(2);
  ArrayList<String> names = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie")); // Initialization with elements
  ```

In summary, use arrays when the number of elements is fixed and performance is critical. Use `ArrayList` when you need flexibility in terms of size and need to frequently manipulate the collection.
