A linked list is a dynamic data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, 
each containing two components:

1. Data: The value or information stored in the node.
2. Next Pointer: A reference or link to the next node in the sequence.

Characteristics of Linked Lists:

- Head Node: The first node in the list, used as a reference point to access the entire list.
- Tail Node: The last node in the list, which has a `next` pointer set to `null`, 
indicating the end of the list.

Types of Linked Lists:

- Singly Linked List: Each node points only to the next node.
- Doubly Linked List**: Each node has pointers to both the next and previous nodes, 
allowing bidirectional traversal.
- Circular Linked List: The last nodeâ€™s pointer refers back to the head, 
forming a closed loop.

Advantages:

- Dynamic Size: The size of the linked list can grow or shrink as needed during runtime.
- Efficient Insertions and Deletions: Adding or removing nodes does not require shifting elements, 
as is the case with arrays.

Disadvantages:

- Memory Overhead: Each node requires additional memory for storing the pointer.
- Linear Access Time: Accessing an element requires traversing the list from the head, 
leading to O(n) time complexity for element access.

Basic Operations:

- Insertion: Adding a new node at the beginning, end, or any specified position in the list.
- Deletion: Removing a node from the beginning, end, or any specified position.
- Traversal: Going through each node in the list to access or modify data.

Use Cases:

Linked lists are well-suited for applications where frequent insertions and deletions are needed, 
such as in implementing stacks, queues, and managing dynamic memory allocation.
