In Java, when you're working with objects, 
you often need to copy them. 
But not all copies are created equal! 
There are two main types of copying: 
shallow copy and deep copy.

1. **Shallow Copy**:
   - Imagine you have a box, and inside that box, 
   there are some smaller boxes (objects). 
   When you make a shallow copy, you're basically making a new big box, 
   but you're not copying the smaller boxes inside. 
   Instead, you just put references (pointers) to the same smaller boxes that were 
   in the original big box. So, both the original big box and the new big box point to the same smaller boxes.
   - In Java, this means copying an object but not its contained objects. 
   So, if you change something inside one of the smaller boxes in the original big box, 
   you'll see that change in the copied big box too because they're 
   both pointing to the same smaller boxes.
   -> changes reflect


2. **Deep Copy**:
   - Now, let's say you want to make a true, independent copy. 
   You want a new big box, and inside that big box, 
   you want to put new smaller boxes that are exact copies of the ones in the original big box. 
   This way, if you change something in one of the smaller boxes in the original big box, 
   it won't affect the copied big box because they're totally separate.
   - In Java, this means copying an object and also creating new copies of all the objects it contains. 
   So, even if you change something in one of the contained objects in the original object, 
   the copied object remains unaffected because it has its own separate copies of the contained objects.
   -> changes does not reflect

In summary, a shallow copy just copies the references to the contained objects, 
while a deep copy creates new copies of the contained objects themselves. Depending on your needs, 
you'll choose between shallow and deep copy to make sure you're getting the behavior 
you want when working with copies of objects in Java.
