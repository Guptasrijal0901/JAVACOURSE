// Certainly! Let's break down the statement:

// ```java
// int count = strCount(str, n + 1);
// ```

// This line of code is a recursive call to the `strCount` method with two arguments: 
// the string `str` and `n + 1`. 

// - `str` is the original string that we're counting the length of.
// - `n + 1` is the position in the string where we're currently counting. 

// By passing `n + 1` in the recursive call, we move one position forward in the string, 
// getting closer to the base case where `n` equals the length of the string.

// ```java
// return 1 + count;
// ```

// This line calculates the count for the current position (`n`) and returns it. 

// - `count` holds the count of characters remaining in the string starting from position `n + 1`.
// - By adding `1` to `count`, we count the character at the current position (`n`) as well.

// So, in essence, this statement is recursively counting the characters in the string by moving 
// through each position in the string until the base case is reached, 
//and then adding up the counts as it returns from each recursive call.
