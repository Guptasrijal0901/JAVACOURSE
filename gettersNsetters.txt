In Java, getters and setters are methods used to access 
and modify the private fields (variables) 
of a class from outside the class. 

- Getters (also known as accessor methods) 
are used to retrieve the value of a private field.
- Setters (also known as mutator methods) 
are used to modify the value of a private field.

Here's a simple example:

public class Person {
    private String name;

    // Getter method
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    // Setter method
    public void setName(String newName) {
        this.name = newName;
    }
}

In this example, `getName()` is a getter method that retrieves the value of the 
`name` field, and `setName(String newName)` is a setter method that modifies the 
value of the `name` field. Using getters and setters allows for better control over 
access to the fields of a class and facilitates encapsulation in object-oriented programming.
