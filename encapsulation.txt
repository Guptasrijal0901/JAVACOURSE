Encapsulation in Java, in simple terms, 
is the idea of bundling data (variables) and 
methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, called a class. 

It's like putting things in a box: you have your data (like variables) 
and the operations on that data (like methods), 
and you keep them together within the class. 
This helps in hiding the internal state of an object from the outside world 
and only exposing the necessary functionalities.

In essence, encapsulation helps in achieving data abstraction, 
data hiding, and modularity, making your code more organized, 
maintainable, and secure.
