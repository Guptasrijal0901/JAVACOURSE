Inheritance in Java is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) 
that allows a new class (called a "subclass" or "child class") to inherit 
properties and behaviors from an existing class (called a "superclass" or "parent class").

Imagine you have a class called "Vehicle" with properties like "color" and "speed", 
and behaviors like "drive" and "stop". Now, you want to create a more specific type of vehicle, 
like a "Car". Instead of rewriting all the properties and behaviors for a car, 
you can simply make the "Car" class inherit from the "Vehicle" class. 
This means the "Car" class automatically gets all the properties and
behaviors of the "Vehicle" class.

In simple terms, inheritance allows you to create new classes based on existing ones, 
saving you time and making your code more organized and reusable. 
It promotes code reuse and helps in creating a hierarchical relationship between classes, 
where subclasses can extend and specialize the functionality of their parent classes.
