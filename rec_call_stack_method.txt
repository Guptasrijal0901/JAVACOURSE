Sure, I'll explain recursion and the call stack method in simple terms with an example.

Imagine you have a stack of plates. When you put a new plate on top, it becomes the top plate. 
Similarly, when a function (let's call it "Function A") calls itself, 
it's like putting a new plate on top of the stack.

Let's use a simple example: calculating the factorial of a number.

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)
```

Now, let's calculate `factorial(3)` using recursion.

1. **Initial Call**: `factorial(3)` is called.
   
   The function checks if `n` is not equal to 0 (which is true), 
   so it goes to the else block and returns `3 * factorial(2)`.

2. **Second Call**: `factorial(2)` is called.
   
   This time, it also checks if `n` is not equal to 0 (which is true), so it returns `2 * factorial(1)`.

3. **Third Call**: `factorial(1)` is called.
   
   `n` is not equal to 0 (which is true), so it returns `1 * factorial(0)`.

4. **Fourth Call**: `factorial(0)` is called.
   
   Now, `n` is equal to 0, so it returns 1.

Now, the call stack starts to unwind:

- The result of `factorial(0)` is 1.
- Then, `factorial(1)` returns `1 * 1`, which is 1.
- Next, `factorial(2)` returns `2 * 1`, which is 2.
- Finally, `factorial(3)` returns `3 * 2`, which is 6.

So, the result of `factorial(3)` is 6.

In simple terms, think of each function call as putting a plate on top of a stack. 
When the function reaches its base case (like `factorial(0)` in this example), 
it starts taking plates off the stack and processing them until it reaches the initial call.
This way, each function call waits for the next one to finish before it can complete.
