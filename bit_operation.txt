In Java, when we talk about the "ith bit," we're referring to a specific bit within a binary representation of a number. Let's break it down:

1. **Binary Representation**: In Java (and in computers in general), 
numbers are stored in binary, which means they're represented using only two digits: 0 and 1. 
For example, the number 5 is represented as 101 in binary, and 9 is represented as 1001.

2. **Indexing Bits**: Each digit in a binary number has a position, 
and we can refer to these positions using indices. The rightmost digit is the 0th bit, 
the next one is the 1st bit, then the 2nd, and so on. For example, in the binary number 101, the 0th bit is 1, 
the 1st bit is 0, and the 2nd bit is 1.

3. **Accessing the "ith" Bit**: When we say the "ith" bit, we mean the bit at the position represented by the index i. 
So, if i is 0, we're referring to the rightmost bit; if i is 1, we're referring to the next bit to the left, and so on.

Here's a simple example in Java code:

```java
// Function to get the ith bit of a number
static int getIthBit(int num, int i) {
    // Shifting the 1st bit of num i positions to the right
    // This isolates the ith bit
    int mask = 1 << i;
    // Performing bitwise AND operation with num
    // This sets all bits to 0 except the ith bit
    int result = num & mask;
    // If result is 0, the ith bit is 0; otherwise, it's 1
    return (result == 0) ? 0 : 1;
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    int number = 9; // Binary representation: 1001
    int ith = 2;    // We want to find the 2nd bit (0-indexed)
    System.out.println("The " + ith + "th bit of " + number + " is: " + getIthBit(number, ith));
}
```

In this example, 
we have a function `getIthBit` that takes a number and an index as input and returns the value of the bit at that index. 
In the `main` method, we call this function with `number = 9` (binary 1001) and `ith = 2`, 
asking for the value of the 2nd bit (0-indexed), which is 0.
