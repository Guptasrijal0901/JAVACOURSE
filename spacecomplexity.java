// Space complexity(input space + auxillary space(temporay array like we do in swapping of array)) 
// in Java (or any programming language) is about how much memory a program uses while it runs. 

// Think of it like packing a suitcase:

// - **Variables**: Each item you pack takes up some space in your 
// suitcase. In your program, each variable (like `int`, `double`, or `String`) takes up some memory.
// - **Data Structures**: If you pack a box inside your suitcase, 
// it can hold multiple items but takes up space itself. 
// Similarly, data structures like arrays, lists, and maps hold multiple values and take up memory.
// - **Functions**: When you pack clothes, you might fold them a certain way. 
// Functions in your code also use memory to store temporary variables and manage tasks.

// When we talk about space complexity, we're asking: "How much space (memory) 
// does this program need as it runs, and how does that space grow if we have more data?"

// For example, if you have an array with 10 items, it takes a certain amount of space. 
// If you increase it to 100 items, it will need more space. 
// Space complexity helps us understand this growth.

// In very simple terms, it's about knowing how much memory your program needs 
// and how that memory usage changes when you have more data or do more things.
