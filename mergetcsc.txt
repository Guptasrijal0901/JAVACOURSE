Sure! Let's break it down into simpler steps:

### What is Merge Sort?
Merge Sort is a way to sort a list or array by breaking it down into smaller parts, 
sorting those parts, and then putting them back together in order.

### Steps of Merge Sort:

1. **Divide**:
   - Split the list into two smaller lists.

2. **Conquer**:
   - Keep splitting the lists until each list has only one element (a single element is already sorted).

3. **Combine**:
   - Merge the smaller sorted lists back together to form a larger sorted list.

### Example:

Imagine you have a list of numbers: `[38, 27, 43, 3, 9, 82, 10]`.

1. **Divide**:
   - Split into two lists: `[38, 27, 43]` and `[3, 9, 82, 10]`.

2. **Keep Dividing**:
   - `[38, 27, 43]` becomes `[38]` and `[27, 43]`, and then `[27, 43]` becomes `[27]` and `[43]`.
   - `[3, 9, 82, 10]` becomes `[3, 9]` and `[82, 10]`, and 
   then `[3, 9]` becomes `[3]` and `[9]`, and `[82, 10]` becomes `[82]` and `[10]`.

3. **Conquer** (since single elements are already sorted):
   - Now you have single-element lists: `[38]`, `[27]`, `[43]`, `[3]`, `[9]`, `[82]`, `[10]`.

4. **Combine**:
   - Start merging the single-element lists into sorted lists: 
     - `[27]` and `[43]` merge to `[27, 43]`.
     - `[3]` and `[9]` merge to `[3, 9]`.
     - `[82]` and `[10]` merge to `[10, 82]`.
   - Keep merging:
     - `[38]` and `[27, 43]` merge to `[27, 38, 43]`.
     - `[3, 9]` and `[10, 82]` merge to `[3, 9, 10, 82]`.
   - Finally, merge the two large lists:
     - `[27, 38, 43]` and `[3, 9, 10, 82]` merge to `[3, 9, 10, 27, 38, 43, 82]`.

### Time Complexity (TC) and Space Complexity (SC):

- **Time Complexity**: Merge Sort always takes \(O(n \log n)\) time to sort a list of \(n\) elements. 
This is because it splits the list \(\log n\) times (the depth of the recursive calls) 
and takes \(O(n)\) time to merge the split lists at each level.
  
- **Space Complexity**: Merge Sort requires \(O(n)\) additional space for the temporary arrays used during merging. 
This is because it needs to store elements of both halves during the merge process.
