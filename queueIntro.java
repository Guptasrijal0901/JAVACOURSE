// A Queue in Java is a data structure that follows the First In, First Out
// (FIFO) principle.
// This means that the first element added to the queue will be the first one to
// be removed.

// You can think of a queue like a line of people waiting for somethingâ€”like in
// a bank or at a movie theater.
// The person who gets in line first is the first one to be served, and the last
// person in line has to wait until everyone before them is served.
// add O(n)- Enque
// remove O(1)- Dequeue
// peek O(1)- Front
