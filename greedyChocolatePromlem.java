// We are given a bar of chocolate composed of mXn square pieces. One should
// break the chocolate into single square.
// Each break of a part of the chocolate is charged is a cost expresed by a
// positive integer.
// this cost does not depend on the size of the part that is being broken but
// only depends on the line the break goes along.
// Let us donate the costs of breaking along consecutive vertical lines with x1,
// x2, ......., xm-1
// and along horzontal lines with y1, y2, ......yn-1
// compute the minimal cost of breaking the whole chocolate inti single squares
