Backtracking in Java (and in programming in general) is a technique used to solve problems incrementally by trying out different possibilities. If you find that a possibility does not lead to a solution, you backtrack, or undo the last step, and try a different possibility. 

Here's a simple way to understand it:

1. **Make a choice:** You start with a choice, such as picking an element or moving in a certain direction.
2. **Explore:** Proceed with this choice and explore further by making more choices.
3. **Backtrack:** If you reach a point where no further progress can be made or a wrong choice was made, undo the last choice (go back) and try another option.

This process continues until you either find a solution or exhaust all possibilities.

### Example: Solving a Maze
Imagine you're trying to find your way out of a maze:

1. **Make a choice:** You start at the entrance and choose to move in one direction, say north.
2. **Explore:** You continue moving north as long as possible, making turns when needed.
3. **Backtrack:** If you hit a dead end, you backtrack to the last decision point and try a different direction, like east or west.

This continues until you find the exit or confirm there is no possible way out.

### Simple Java Example: Finding Subsets

Here's a simple example in Java using backtracking to find all subsets of a given set of numbers:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Subsets {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] nums = {1, 2, 3};
        List<List<Integer>> result = new ArrayList<>();
        backtrack(result, new ArrayList<>(), nums, 0);
        System.out.println(result);
    }

    private static void backtrack(List<List<Integer>> result, List<Integer> tempList, int[] nums, int start) {
        result.add(new ArrayList<>(tempList));
        for (int i = start; i < nums.length; i++) {
            tempList.add(nums[i]);
            backtrack(result, tempList, nums, i + 1); // Make the next choice
            tempList.remove(tempList.size() - 1); // Undo the choice (backtrack)
        }
    }
}
```

In this code:
- We start with an empty list (`tempList`).
- We explore adding each number to the list.
- If adding a number does not lead to a solution, we backtrack by removing the last added number and try the next possibility.

This way, we generate all possible subsets of the set `{1, 2, 3}`.
